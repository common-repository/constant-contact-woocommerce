#### Unable to connect WooCommerce to Constant Contact
A benefit of using WordPress is that it's Open Source Software (OSS), meaning its developers are free to modify and enhance the source code. Because this includes WordPress plugins, plugins can sometimes interact with each other in unexpected ways. If you're having trouble connecting WooCommerce to your Constant Contact account, it's likely an interaction between plugins in your WordPress account causing the issue.
[Fortunately, there are steps you can take to resolve this.](https://knowledgebase.constantcontact.com/articles/KnowledgeBase/34401-Unable-to-Connect-WooCommerce-to-Constant-Contact?q=woocommerce&pnx=1&lang=en_US)

#### How to use the Product Block to insert WooCommerce Products to an Email
If you sell products through a WooCommerce store, you can promote your goods to your contacts by dragging a WooCommerce action block directly into your Constant Contact email template.

#### How to Create an Automated Abandoned Cart Reminder Email for WooCommerce
If you have a WooCommerce store, you've probably had people who added items to their shopping cart but didn't complete the purchase. Some of these customers may have changed their minds about making their purchase, but others may not have intended to abandon their cart. Setting up an automated Abandoned Cart Reminder Email re-engages those customers who left the purchase flow, and encourages them to follow-through.
